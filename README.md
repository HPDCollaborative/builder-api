# HPD Builder API - Partner Repository

Welcome to the HPD Builder API partner repository! This is your gateway to interact with the HPD Collaborative team regarding the Builder API.

## 🏗️ What is the HPD Builder API?

The HPD Builder API is a powerful interface that enables partners to integrate with the HPD (Health Product Declaration) Builder platform. This API allows you to:

- **Access HPD data** programmatically
- **Submit and manage** health product declarations
- **Integrate HPD workflows** into your existing systems
- **Automate data exchange** between your platform and the HPD ecosystem

The Builder API serves as the backbone for partner integrations, enabling seamless data flow and collaboration within the health product transparency ecosystem.
